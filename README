BioPig

This project provides additional apache pig commands and data loaders/writers specific
for biologicial sequence data.  Specifically, biopig supports the following functionality:
  - load fasta and fastq files
  - filter sequence data by id, header or size
  - generate kmers
  - wrappers for common external programs (Blast, Newbler, velvet, cap3, etc)

With biopig, users can write data parallel analysis tools that get executed on a hadoop
map/reduce cluster such as NERSC's Magellan or AWS's Elastic MapReduce.
