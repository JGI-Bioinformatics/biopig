Installation
------------

This directory contains the binaries for commandline tools to manage the cloud-based rumen
metagenomics pipeline.  This file describes the installation of the software.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

You need java and groovy, I'm assuming you have that setup up the path variables such
that % java  and % groovysh work.  It also assumes that you have a hadoop cluster and
the hadoop executable should be setup in the path as well.  You can still use this without
a cluster, by default the hadoop commandline will run in single-node mode.
