README file for meta project (commandline tools for managing metagenomics pipeline)

This directory contains the source code for commandline tools to manage the cloud-based rumen
metagenomics pipeline.  The pipeline uses cassandra for data storage and map/reduce for computation.
The commandline program developed here is used to manage the cassandra data store:  load data,
query and manipulate as needed.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

You need java and groovy.  Of course you need your cassandra datastore up somewhere as well
otherwise there is not much for this program to do.


To INSTALL
----------

if java and groovy are working properly (ie, % groovysh works) then you should be able to
execute
   % bin/meta --help
to test.

There's only one main executable and doing a help will give you all the options.


DEFAULTS
--------

The commandline tool reads a properties file from your home directory, ~/.meta-prefs and
can use those values as defaults to decrease the number of parameters that are needed.

List of properties that can be set:

   meta.defaultKeySpace


USAGE
------

% meta --help


1.  Query the data model

   % meta -c <cassandra server> query <-k keyspace>


2.  bulk load sequences


3.  scan sequences from datastore


4.  show all columns from particular key
