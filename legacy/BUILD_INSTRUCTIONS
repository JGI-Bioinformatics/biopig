meta build instructions
-----------------------

If you want to compile from source you will need the following:

  - java compiler
  - maven build system

steps:
  1. add specific libraries to your local maven repository
  2. build and package using maven2
  3. install binary package

1. add non-maven libraries to your local maven repository
---------------------------------------------------------

Maven is great, however not all libraries are always available from
maven repos.  The directory nonmavenlibs contains a set of jars that
aren't found in any repo.  you will need to add them to your local
maven repository (by default that's ~/.m2).  just run the following
script:

    % cd nonmavenlibs; ./installLibsInMaven.sh

this will generate appropriate maven metadata.

2. build and package using maven2
---------------------------------

building is easy, once maven2 is installed.

    % mvn package

This will compile the source code and generate a binary .tgz file in

    ./meta/target/meta-1.0-beta1-bin.tar.gz  (for example, your file may
                                              have a different version)


3. install binary package
-------------------------

You can install the binary package anywhere you like.  for example:

    % cat meta/target/meta-1.0-beta1-bin.tar.gz | tar -zxvf - -C /usr/local

this will create the directory /usr/local/meta-1.0-beta1 which will look
something like:

karans-macbook:git.metagenomics dev$ ls -l /usr/local/meta-1.0-beta1/
total 104
